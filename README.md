**Applied Machine Learning Algorithms.**

_Here we will apply the data preprocessing steps and a set of machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter tunning._

**Generic Steps are as follows:**

#### _Step1 : Access data and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)_
  ##### Univariate Analysis
  ##### Bi-variate Analysis
  ##### Multi-variate Analysis
  
#### _Step2 : Pre-processing Steps_
  ##### 2.1 Filling the missing values : Categorical with Mode and Continous with Mean
  ##### 2.2 Converting categories to numbers
  ##### 2.3 Bring all the variables in range 0 to 1

#### _Step 3 : Segregate the data into Features(X) and Target(y) and later perform Train, Validation & Test splits_

#### _Step 4 : Try Multiple algorithms of Machine Learning for Select the champion(best) model._
  ##### 4.1 : Create a Model with Decision Tree and Prune the classification tree with Hyperparameter Tunning
  ##### 4.2 : Create a Model with Logistic Regression and perform Hyperparameter Tunning
  ##### 4.3 : Create a Model with SVM and perform Hyperparameter Tunning
  ##### 4.4 : Create a Model with Random Forest and perform Hyperparameter Tunning
  ##### 4.5 : Create a Model with Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Model and perform Hyperparameter Tunning
  
#### _Step 5 (Summary) : Compare model results and final model selection_
